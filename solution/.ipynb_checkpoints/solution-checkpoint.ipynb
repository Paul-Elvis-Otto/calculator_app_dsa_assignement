    "The `Agent` class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for `Proposer` and `Proposee` subclasses. `Proposer` implements `propose()` by selecting a preferred proposee from its list, while raising an error for `respond()`. Conversely, `Proposee` implements `respond()` with preference-based matching logic, while raising an error for `propose()`. This models a one-way matching system like the stable marriage problem."

    "The algorithm is not efficient. Its time complexity is O(n²) where n represents the size of the array. The algorithm systematically examines all possible contiguous subarrays by using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates through each starting position in the array, while the inner loop extends the subarray from that position to all possible ending positions. For each subarray configuration, the algorithm calculates the sum and updates the maximum if necessary. This approach requires examining approximately n²/2 subarrays, which simplifies to O(n²) in Big-O notation. Therefore, the smallest value of d such that O(n^d) correctly represents the runtime complexity is d = 2.\n",

    "## Task 3.b)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second algorithm implements Kadane's algorithm for finding the maximum subarray sum. It operates with a time complexity of O(n). This algorithm processes the array in a single linear pass, maintaining two variables: a running sum of the current subarray and the maximum sum found so far. For each element, the algorithm makes a critical decision: either start a new subarray beginning with the current element (if the previous running sum became negative) or extend the existing subarray by adding the current element. This approach leverages dynamic programming principles with optimal substructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference in complexity between the two algorithms is substantial. While the first algorithm examines all possible subarrays through brute force requiring quadratic time, the second algorithm achieves the same result in linear time by avoiding redundant calculations. This efficiency difference becomes particularly significant for large inputs. For an array of 10,000 elements, the first algorithm would perform approximately 50 million operations, whereas the second would require only 10,000 operations. The second algorithm demonstrates how intelligent algorithm design can dramatically reduce computational requirements while solving the same problem."
